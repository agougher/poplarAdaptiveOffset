Data and code for: Gougherty, A.V., Keller, S.R. and M.C. Fitzpatrick. Future climate change promotes novel gene-climate associations in balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.), a forest tree species. Link.

### Data
In the data folder are two files, a pairwise $F_{ST}$ table, and a table of minor allele frequencies (MAF), both with data from [Keller et al. 2017](https://academic.oup.com/jhered/article/109/1/47/4605251), for a subset of SNPs in the flowering time gene network in balsam poplar. The $F_{ST}$ table is used to fit a generalized dissimilarity model, and the MAF table is used in a Gradient Forest model.

### Code
I have broken up the code into two scripts, one each for GDM and GF, as it may not always be desired to calculate both.
